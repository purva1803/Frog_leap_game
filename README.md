# Frog_leap_game:
This Python script implements a simple console-based Frog Jump Puzzle Game. The game consists of a row of frogs, represented by the letters 'G' and 'B', with an empty space denoted by '-'. The player can jump frogs over each other, either to the right (for 'G' frogs) or to the left (for 'B' frogs), aiming to reach the winning configuration: ['B', 'B', 'B', '-', 'G', 'G', 'G'].

How to Play:

1.Run the script in a Python environment.

2.The initial game state is displayed, showing the current positions of 'G' and 'B' frogs.

3.Enter the position of the frog you want to move (0 to 6) or 'q' to quit.

4.Follow the on-screen instructions for valid moves based on the selected frog ('G' or 'B').

5.Continue making moves until you win the game or choose to quit.

The game provides feedback on each move, displays the updated game state after each valid move, and ends with a "You Win!" message when the winning configuration is reached. The script is designed for simplicity and ease of understanding, making it a fun and interactive console game.
